# Periodic Staking Rewards

> Still work-in-progress (WIP)

Staking smart contract vault that issues ETH or token rewards to stakers. Rewards are issued for a selected period (e.g. 1 week).

The PeriodicEthRewards.sol is partially compatible with ERC-4626 (some of the important function headers are the same).

Actions:
- Claim
- Deposit & Lock & Claim
- Withdraw & Claim

TODO:
- Tests

## Use at your own risk
