# ERC-4626 Periodic ETH Rewards

An ERC-4626 compatible smart contract vault that issues ETH rewards to stakers. Rewards are issued for a selected period (e.g. 1 week).

> Still work-in-progress (WIP)

TODO:
- Name and Symbol dynamically set through constructor
- An minimum amount of ETH for rewards to be issued in the previous period
- Owner can remove ETH from the contract (debatable, although ownership can be renounced)
- Tests
